 * 	OTP feature map.
 * 	An OTP field named in the corresponding SoC e.g 63138-63146 or 6858-6855 is being assigned a feature name
 * 	OTP map feature name closely resembles a specific OTP map row name. Other entries server as delimiters. 
 * 	This allows to unify access to OTP map across all SoCs  	
 * 	Whenever new otp field is needed to be read or fused it neets to be declared here and subsequently mapped in
 * 	the driver initilizer function to the feature name
 * 	Example:
 * 	OTP_MAP_LDO_TRIM -feature name 
 * 	OTP_MAP_LDO_TRIM_ROW - as defined in otp specific arch

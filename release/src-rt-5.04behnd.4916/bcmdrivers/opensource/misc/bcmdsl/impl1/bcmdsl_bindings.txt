Broadcom DSL parameters device tree bindings
============================================

Broadcom bcmdsl driver parses the dsl board parameters from board dts file and
make them available to the core DSL driver to use.

The parameters are defined in each line's node as a device tree node property in
the corresponding <boardid>.dts file. For customers that use board parameter in
earlier release, all the DSL board parameters for the supported chips are
converted to device tree. The following properties are supported in device tree
bindings.

1.  DSL AFE ID
    afeid = <(AFE_ID_DEFINTION)>;
    secondary-afeid = <(AFE_ID_DEFINTION)>;
    AFE_ID_DEFINTION is defined in bcmdrivers/opensource/include/bcm963xx/\
	bcm_dsl_dt_bindings.h

2. DSL GPIOs
   pwrboost-gpio, relay-gpio, reset-gpio, vr5p3pwr-gpio, tddenable-gpio. It follows the standard
   device tree gpio definiton, for example:
      pwrboost-gpio = <&gpioc 32 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

3. DSL control pins
   The DSL control pins require two properties: pintrl-0 for pinmux setting and
   a corresponding ctrl id for that pin. The following ctrl pin are defined:
       afe-mode-ctl, afe-pwr-ctl, afe-data-ctl, afe-clk-ctl
   To define afe power control pin,
       pinctrl-0 = <&vdsl_ctrl_0_pin_87>;
   	   afe-pwr-ctl = <AFE_VDSLCTL_0>;
   Please refer to <chip>_pinctrl.dtsi and pinmux document for ctrl pin node
   name and its ctrl id value.  Usually this is not needed because the Broadcom
   reference board dts already has all the ctrl pin definitions and user just
   need to copy to their board dts based on the board design.


Below is the full dsl dts definition example from 63146REF1D board:

&dsl {
	line0@0 {
		pinctrl-0 = <&vdsl_ctrl_0_pin_87 &vdsl_ctrl_1_pin_17 &vdsl_ctrl_2_pin_34>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";

		afeid = <(AFE_CHIP_GFAST_CH0 | AFE_LD_6305 | AFE_FE_REV_6305_REV_12_5_80\
		   | AFE_FE_RNC)>;
		secondary-afeid = <(AFE_CHIP_GFAST_CH0 | AFE_LD_6303 | AFE_FE_ANNEXA\
		   | AFE_FE_REV_6303_146__REV_12_3_60 | AFE_FE_RNC)>;
		afe-pwr-ctl = <AFE_VDSLCTL_0>;
		afe-data-ctl = <AFE_VDSLCTL_1>;
		afe-clk-ctl = <AFE_VDSLCTL_2>;

		relay-gpio = <&gpioc 31 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		status = "okay";
	};

	line1@1 {
		pinctrl-0 = <&vdsl_ctrl_3_pin_33 &vdsl_ctrl_4_pin_86 &vdsl_ctrl_5_pin_84>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";

		afeid = <(AFE_CHIP_GFAST_CH1 | AFE_LD_6303 | AFE_FE_ANNEXA\
		    | AFE_FE_REV_6303_146__REV_12_3_85 | AFE_FE_RNC)>;
		secondary-afeid = <(AFE_CHIP_GFAST_CH1 | AFE_LD_6303 | AFE_FE_ANNEXA\
		    | AFE_FE_REV_6303_146__REV_12_3_85 | AFE_FE_RNC)>;
		afe-pwr-ctl = <AFE_VDSLCTL_3>;
		afe-data-ctl = <AFE_VDSLCTL_4>;
		afe-clk-ctl = <AFE_VDSLCTL_5>;

		status = "okay";
	};
};
